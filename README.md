🚢 Performed Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset from Kaggle
This project focused on transforming raw passenger data into meaningful insights through comprehensive data preprocessing and analysis. By uncovering relationships between features like age, gender, class, and survival status, I was able to extract patterns that reflect real-world decision-making scenarios in critical conditions.

✨ Key Highlights:

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation: Addressed missing values in key columns (like Age, Cabin, and Embarked), converted categorical variables into numerical formats, and handled outliers for accurate analysis.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducted in-depth EDA to identify correlations and distributions across features. Explored survival rates by gender, age group, class, and family size, using Seaborn and Matplotlib for compelling visual insights.

📌 Feature Engineering: Created new variables such as Title (from Name), FamilySize, and IsAlone to enhance the dataset’s predictive power for future modeling.

📉 Trend & Pattern Recognition: Discovered that women and children in higher classes had a higher chance of survival, revealing social dynamics at play during the disaster.

🧠 Analytical Thinking: Applied grouping, aggregation, and pivot table logic in Pandas to dissect relationships and better understand the impact of multiple variables on survival.

📈 Insightful Visualizations: Designed bar charts, histograms, violin plots, and heatmaps to visually communicate data distributions and relationships in a clear and impactful way.

🔍 Foundations for Modeling: This EDA served as a foundation for building classification models by highlighting the most predictive features and data preparation techniques.
